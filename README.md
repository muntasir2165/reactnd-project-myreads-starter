# MyReads: A Book Tracking App

This is the finished app for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

The app utilizes React and associated fundamental concepts in the framework to design and develop the front-end. The app makes use of class- and function-based React components, react-router and state management by storing data in the components' closest common ancestor (in this case, the App component).
